# GES772-FinalProject
Final Project for GES 772 Fall 2020
\
The idea of this project is to help people find United States Superfund sites, learn about sites, and possibly figure out ways to help.\
\
A secondary objective is to help people figure out spatial relationships between schools and Superfund sites.\
\
Goal is to have a web application with at least a three facet search\
\
Facet possibilities:\
State\
Pollution Type\
Site Status\
\
Users should see a pop-up when they click on a site\
Pop-up information posibilities:\
Site details\
Political Representaion\
